# Docker Project: Run Docker Run

This is one of the projects provided by JetBrains Academy, a platform for studying programming languages.

## Objectives

- Build a `Dockerfile` to deploy a simple Flask application;
- Install python requirements for the application;
- Learn how to use `EXPOSE`, `WORKDIR`, `ADD`, `RUN` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions with the appropriate arguments for this application.

## Structure

The main files of interest are available at:

- `.\Run Docker Run\task\hyper-app`

The project was mostly about creating the `Dockerfile` present at:

-  `.\Run Docker Run\task\Dockerfile`

Files on other directories were automatically created by the course.
