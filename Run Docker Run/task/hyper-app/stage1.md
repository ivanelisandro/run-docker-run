# Stage 1:

In this project, we will create a custom image that runs a simple Flask application.

The application is already present in the `hyper-app` directory in your project directory.

In this stage we will pull the base image from the docker hub.

## Objectives

- Pull the image `python:3.11-slim` from Docker Hub.
